jspayloads
==========

Payloads to be used in XSS attacks.

Introduction
------------

Just a bunch of fun JavaScript payloads to use in XSS/CSRF attacks and the like for CTFs, competitions, demonstrations, whatever. You may want to obfuscate/encode the scripts before you use them, depends on what you want to do.

As always, do not use any of these scripts for illicit purposes. Obtain permission from the owner of the web app you are trying to exploit.
